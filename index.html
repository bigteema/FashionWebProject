        <h1>Welcome to My Archival Fashion Space</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m Tima, a senior at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Economics.
          I love archival fashion, sourcing, reselling, and authenticating vintage designer pieces.
          I study how construction, materials, and design details tell stories about their eras.
          This site mixes my academic side with my creative side :)
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ll find an Archive Guide about authenticating Chanel, Balenciaga, and Jean Paul Gaultier,
          and other vintage designer brands, plus a Curations page with my favorite runway pieces and playlists 
          I made to match the vibe. My goal is to show how data, design, and culture overlap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond collecting and researching, I like building simple systems that make the hunt easier,
          like checklists for serial codes, quick hardware guides, and reference boards for colorways.
          I also enjoy writing short notes about why a piece feels special, since story and context
          matter as much as materials. This site is my way of keeping everything in one place while
          sharing the process with anyone who loves archival fashion too.

      <p>
        I also work on data projects that connect creativity and analytics. My favorite ones involve
        sentiment analysis, visualization, and storytelling. These specific projects are related to what 
        I study in school. Mostly relating to financial sentiments and risk analysis.
