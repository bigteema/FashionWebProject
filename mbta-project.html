      <h1>MBTA Ridership Analysis (2018–2025)</h1>
      <p class="subhead">
        A multi-layered analysis of Boston’s transit system, exploring systemwide trends, pandemic disruptions, 
        event-driven ridership spikes, and long-term behavioral shifts.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I analyzed over six years of MBTA ridership data to understand how travel patterns in Boston changed across 
          the pandemic, how major events like Red Sox home games affect station-level demand, and how different lines 
          contribute to overall system throughput. I created a suite of static and interactive visualizations using 
          Python and Vega-Lite to uncover patterns in recovery, peak-hour smoothing, and external drivers of ridership.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 1: SYSTEMWIDE PANDEMIC TRENDS -->
      <section>
        <h2>1. Systemwide Trends Across Pandemic Phases</h2>
        <p>
          This visualization breaks the timeline into three eras: pre-pandemic stability, a dramatic mid-pandemic collapse, 
          and a gradual but incomplete recovery. Ridership fell by more than 80 percent in early 2020 and has since 
          stabilized at about 70–80 percent of pre-pandemic levels.

      <!-- SECTION 2: KENMORE AND RED SOX -->
      <section>
        <h2>2. Event-Driven Demand: Red Sox Home Games at Kenmore Station</h2>
        <p>
          Kenmore Station shows clear, predictable ridership spikes tied to Red Sox home games. During baseball season, 
          monthly entries increase by 20–45 percent. This demonstrates how entertainment events create strong, 
          measurable impacts on transit demand.

      <!-- SECTION 3: BUSIEST STATIONS -->
      <section>
        <h2>3. Station-Level Demand</h2>
        <p>
          An interactive ranking of the busiest MBTA stations shows that South Station, Downtown Crossing, 
          and Harvard carry some of the highest daily gate entries. Red and Orange Line stations dominate the top tiers.

      <!-- SECTION 4: LINE-LEVEL RIDERSHIP -->
      <section>
        <h2>4. Line-Level Ridership Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          The Red Line accounts for the largest share of systemwide ridership, followed closely by the Orange Line. 
          The Green Line is more diffuse due to its branches, while the Blue and Silver Lines form smaller but steady portions of demand.

      <!-- SECTION 5: WEATHER SCATTER -->
      <section>
        <h2>5. Weather and Ridership Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          Weather conditions play a measurable role in daily travel decisions. Heavy rain reduces ridership at most stations, 
          and extreme temperatures lead to predictable dips at outdoor-dependent transfer points.

      <!-- SECTION 6: HEATMAP -->
      <section>
        <h2>6. Temporal Patterns: Ridership Heatmap</h2>
        <p>
          The ridership heatmap highlights the smoothing of peak travel hours post-pandemic. Hybrid work schedules shifted 
          travel away from rigid rush hours, distributing demand more evenly across the day.

      <!-- TECHNICAL SECTION -->
      <section>
        <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Processed multi-year ridership datasets and normalized station IDs</li>
          <li>Calculated monthly and daily averages, rolling windows, and seasonal comparisons</li>
          <li>Joined rail ridership data with Red Sox home game schedules</li>
          <li>Designed custom Matplotlib charts with annotations and multi-axis scaling</li>
          <li>Built Vega-Lite interactive graphics for line, station, and weather patterns</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- LEARNING -->
      <section>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This project strengthened my ability to structure large datasets, translate quantitative patterns into 
          clear narratives, and design visuals that reveal meaningful behavior. It helped me understand how 
          data-driven insights support transportation planning, product thinking, and operational decision-making.
